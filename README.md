# Riemann Sum Calculator

The Riemann Sum Calculator is a Java program that helps to approximate the area under a curve by dividing it into smaller rectangular shapes using the Riemann Sum formula. This program is designed for students and professionals in mathematics, engineering, and other fields that require the calculation of areas under curves.

## Features
Calculate the area under a curve using the Riemann Sum formula
Specify the mathematical function and interval to calculate
Choose from different types of Riemann sums (left, right, midpoint)
Adjust the number of subintervals used
Visualize the area approximation graphically

## Installation
To use the Riemann Sum Calculator, you need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download and install Java from the official website: https://www.java.com/en/download/
Next, you need to download the Riemann Sum Calculator repository from GitHub. You can do this by clicking on the green "Code" button and selecting "Download ZIP". Once the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it to a directory of your choice.

## Usage
To use the Riemann Sum Calculator, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you extracted the repository. Then, compile the program by running the following command:
javac RiemannSum.java
This will compile the program and create a class file called "RiemannSum.class". To run the program, use the following command:
java RiemannSum

This will launch the program and prompt you to input the mathematical function, interval, and other parameters. Follow the instructions on the screen to calculate the area under the curve using the Riemann Sum formula.

## Contributing
